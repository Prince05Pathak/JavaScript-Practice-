/*AJAX : Asynchronus javascript and XML
iS a set of "Web development techniques"
Using many web technologies on the client side 
To create asynchronus web applications.

With ajax, web app's can send and retrive data from 
a server asynchrnously (in the background) without 
interfering with the dsisplay and behaviour of the existing page 

(IMP)=> We dont use data in XML format anymore instead we use json


We have # most common ways to create and send requests to server

1). xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2). fetch API (new way of doing)
3). Axios (this is thrid party library)
